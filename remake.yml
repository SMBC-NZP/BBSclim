## Most of a remakefile will be targets.  They can be listed in any
## order; whatever makes most sense.  Files can be split up and
## included into the main file if you need to impose more structure.
targets:
#   ## 'all' is a special target that will be used as the default
#   ## target by 'remake'.  It doesn't actually make anything but
#   ## "depends" on other targets.
   all:
   depends: plot.pdf
# 
# ## 'target_name' is a special variable here: it will pass 'data.csv'
# ## through to the function 'download_data()' so that the data are
# ## stored in the correct place.
# data.csv:
#   command: download_data(target_name)
# 
# ## 'processed' will be stored as an R object because it looks like
# ## an object name rather than a file name (file names have
# ## extensions or slashes in them).  It will be saved across
# ## sessions.  Because it uses "data.csv", remake will work out that
# ## this target depends on "data.csv".
# processed:
#   command: process_data("data.csv")
# 
# ## Specifying 'plot: true' here tells remake that you are creating a
# ## plot.  It will sort out opening/closing the pdf device for you.
# ## Because 'myplot' uses 'processed', remake will work out that this
# ## target requires the processed target to be made first.
# plot.pdf:
#   command: myplot(processed)
# plot: true
# 
# ## Like plot targets, there are also special knitr targets.  This
# ## will arrange for "processed" to be available within the knit
# ## function, along with all functions defined in "code.R".  This
# ## automatically depends on the file report.Rmd, and will be updated
# ## when that file changes or when "processed" changes.
# report.md:
#   depends: processed
# knitr: true
