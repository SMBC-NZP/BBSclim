Title: Analysis of BBS data using correlated occupancy models to examine
    relationship between range dynamics and climate variables
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Clark Rushing, Andy Royle, Keith Pardieck

Description: This project aims to measure the reponse of North American
    bird species to recent climate change using the correlated occupancy models
    described by Hines et al. (2010, 2014). This project builds on the analysis of
    Clement et al. (2015) by applying their approach to a larger number of species.
